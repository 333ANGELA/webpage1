            <h1>Starfish</h1>
            <h2>by Eleanor Lerman</h2>
            <p>
                This is what life does. It lets you walk up to <br>
the store to buy breakfast and the paper, on a <br>
stiff knee. It lets you choose the way you have <br>
your eggs, your coffee. Then it sits a fisherman <br>
down beside you at the counter who say, Last night, <br>
the channel was full of starfish. And you wonder,<br>
is this a message, finally, or just another day?<br>
<br>
Life lets you take the dog for a walk down to the<br>
pond, where whole generations of biological <br>
processes are boiling beneath the mud. Reeds<br>
speak to you of the natural world: they whisper,<br>
they sing. And herons pass by. Are you old <br>
enough to appreciate the moment? Too old?<br>
There is movement beneath the water, but it <br>
may be nothing. There may be nothing going on.<br><br>

And then life suggests that you remember the <br>
years you ran around, the years you developed<br>
a shocking lifestyle, advocated careless abandon,<br>
owned a chilly heart. Upon reflection, you are<br>
genuinely surprised to find how quiet you have<br>
become. And then life lets you go home to think<br>
about all this. Which you do, for quite a long time.<br><br>

Later, you wake up beside your old love, the one<br>
who never had any conditions, the one who waited<br>
you out. This is life’s way of letting you know that<br>
you are lucky. (It won’t give you smart or brave,<br>
so you’ll have to settle for lucky.) Because you <br>
were born at a good time. Because you were able <br>
to listen when people spoke to you. Because you<br>
stopped when you should have and started again.<br><br>

So life lets you have a sandwich, and pie for your<br>
late night dessert. (Pie for the dog, as well.) And <br>
then life sends you back to bed, to dreamland, <br>
while outside, the starfish drift through the channel,<br> 
with smiles on their starry faces as they head<br>
out to deep water, to the far and boundless sea.<br>
